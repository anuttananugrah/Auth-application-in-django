django signals
-----------------

Django signals are a built-in "signal dispatcher" that allows decoupled applications to get 
notified when specific actions occur elsewhere in the framework. They follow a publish-subscribe 
pattern where senders notify a set of receivers (handlers) that an event has taken place. 

    Core Concepts
        Sender: The object or action that triggers the signal (e.g., a model being saved).
        Receiver: A Python function or method that is "connected" to the signal and executes when the signal is sent.
        Dispatcher: The internal Django mechanism that manages the registration and notification of these events. 
    Common Built-in Signals
        Django provides various built-in signals for key framework events: 
        Model Signals: pre_save and post_save (before/after a model instance is saved), pre_delete and post_delete 
        (before/after deletion), and m2m_changed (when a ManyToManyField changes).
        Request/Response Signals: request_started and request_finished (sent when Django starts or finishes an HTTP request).
        Auth Signals: user_logged_in and user_logged_out (triggered when a user authenticates or logs out).
